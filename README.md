# Book Buddy - A Digital Bookshelf and Reading Tracker

## Objective:

Build a web application that allows users to manage their book collection and keep track of their reading progress. The app should include essential features like book listing, categorization, reading progress tracking, and a basic analytics dashboard.

## Phase 1: Junior Level (Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

Goal: Build the core features of Book Buddy with a simple front-end using Vanilla JavaScript. Implement a basic back-end using Node.js and Express to handle API requests and connect with a database (e.g., MongoDB).

Tech Stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express for REST APIs
- Database: MongoDB (or a lightweight JSON file for storing data in early development)
- Version Control: Git for source code management
- Hosting: GitHub Pages or basic server deployment on Heroku

Key Features:

1.	User Authentication (Basic):
	- Simple login and signup functionality.
	- Use bcrypt for password hashing, and store sessions locally.
2.	Book Collection Management:
	- CRUD operations for books (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
	- Each book entry includes title, author, category, and status (e.g., “Want to Read,” “Reading,” “Finished”).
3.	Reading Progress Tracking:
	- Allow users to log their reading progress as a percentage for each book.
	- Update status based on progress (e.g., if 100% complete, mark as “Finished”).
4.	Basic Analytics Dashboard:
	- Simple dashboard showing the number of books in each category (e.g., “Want to Read,” “Reading,” “Finished”).
5.	Responsive UI:
	- Design the UI using responsive CSS so that it’s user-friendly on both desktop and mobile.

Deliverables:
- Functional web app deployed with GitHub Pages or Heroku.
- Basic, working API with endpoints for handling book-related requests.
- Documentation for setup and basic API usage.

## Phase 2: Senior Level (React, RESTful API Enhancements, State Management)

Goal: Improve the app’s interactivity and performance by refactoring the frontend to React. Enhance the back-end API with advanced features, such as search and filtering options.

Tech Stack Enhancements:

	•	Frontend: React for building a dynamic and component-based UI.
	•	State Management: Use Context API or Redux for managing application state.
	•	Backend: Refine REST APIs, add complex queries, and optimize MongoDB.
	•	Hosting: Migrate the app to a more robust cloud platform, such as Vercel or DigitalOcean.

New Features:

	1.	Improved User Authentication:
	•	Implement JWT for secure, token-based authentication.
	2.	Enhanced Book Management:
	•	Advanced filtering and sorting by category, author, and reading status.
	3.	Enhanced Reading Progress and Reminders:
	•	Add the ability to set reading reminders and personalized goals for each book.
	4.	Data Persistence and Optimized State Management:
	•	Save book data and user session data in a more optimized way using React Context API or Redux.

Deliverables:

	•	A polished UI with React, providing a seamless user experience.
	•	RESTful API with filtering and sorting capabilities.
	•	Full project documentation and deployment on a scalable platform.

## Phase 3: Master’s Level (Next.js, GraphQL, Server-Side Rendering, and Microservices)

Goal: Convert the app to a server-rendered application for SEO benefits and integrate GraphQL for efficient data fetching. Add a microservices architecture for scalability and real-time notifications.

Tech Stack Enhancements:

	•	Frontend: Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and improved SEO.
	•	Backend: Convert REST API to GraphQL for more flexible data retrieval.
	•	Microservices: Split the app’s functionalities into microservices (e.g., user service, book service, analytics).
	•	Real-time Messaging: WebSocket or Firebase for real-time notifications.
	•	DevOps: Dockerize the application, CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

Advanced Features:

	1.	Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and SEO:
	•	Use Next.js to render pages server-side for better SEO and performance.
	2.	GraphQL for Efficient Data Management:
	•	Replace REST endpoints with GraphQL for improved data fetching and flexibility.
	3.	Real-Time Notifications:
	•	Notify users of reading reminders and goals in real-time.
	4.	Microservices Architecture:
	•	Implement a microservice for each core feature (e.g., user management, book tracking).
	•	Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
	5.	Scalable Analytics and Reporting:
	•	Advanced analytics on user reading trends, book categories, and goals.

Deliverables:

	•	Fully-functional, scalable web application using a microservices architecture.
	•	Real-time updates and advanced data fetching with GraphQL.
	•	Complete CI/CD pipeline, automated testing, and end-to-end documentation.

This project structure will progressively build your full-stack development skills, starting from Vanilla JavaScript and core web fundamentals to advanced frameworks, API management, and microservices at the Master’s level. By the end, you’ll have a complete, scalable digital bookshelf and reading tracker app ready for real-world use and your portfolio.
